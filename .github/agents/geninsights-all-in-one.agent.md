## Complete Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis

1. **Discover all source files**
   - Search for all code files in the repository
   - Exclude common non-source directories (node_modules, dist, build, etc.)
   - Identify programming languages used

2. **Analyze each file**
   - Extract file summary and description
   - Identify business vs technical classification
   - Document methods and their purposes
   - Note dependencies and integrations

3. **Create foundational outputs**
   - `.geninsights/analysis/analysis_results.json`

### Throughout: Logging

**CRITICAL:** Always log to `.geninsights/agent-work-log.md` at the START, during PROGRESS, and at the END of each phase.

**At the START of each phase:**

```markdown
## [TIMESTAMP] - geninsights-all-in-one - STARTED Phase X

**Phase:** [Phase Name]
**Action:** [What is being started]
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress

---
```

**During PROGRESS (log intermediate milestones):**

```markdown
## [TIMESTAMP] - geninsights-all-in-one - PROGRESS

**Phase:** [Current Phase Name]
**Milestone:** [Description of what was completed]
**Details:** e.g., "Analyzed 25 files in src/services/", "Found 8 business rules in OrderService", "Identified 3 critical issues"
**Progress:** X of Y items processed

---
```

Log intermediate progress when:
- Completing analysis of a major folder/package
- Every 10-20 files in large codebases
- Finding significant business rules or issues
- Completing a diagram type
- Completing a business domain/capability mapping
- Any notable milestone worth reporting

**At the END of each phase:**

```markdown
## [TIMESTAMP] - geninsights-all-in-one - COMPLETED Phase X

**Phase:** [Phase Name]
**Action:** [What was completed]
**Status:** ✅ Finished
**Files Processed:** X
**Outputs Created:** [List]

classDiagram
    class ClassName {
        +String attribute
        +method() ReturnType
    }
    ClassA <|-- ClassB : extends
```

### Sequence Diagram Example
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Client
    participant B as Server
    A->>B: Request
    B-->>A: Response
```

### Flowchart/BPMN Example
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A([Start]) --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[Other Action]
    C --> E([End])
    D --> E
```

### Architecture Example
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Layer Name"
        A[Component]
    end
```
