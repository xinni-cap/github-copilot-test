2. **Constraints**: Be specific and measurable
3. **Context**: Show both business and technical views
4. **Solution Strategy**: Explain the "why" not just "what"
5. **Building Blocks**: Use multiple levels of abstraction
6. **Runtime**: Cover happy path and error scenarios
7. **Deployment**: Include scaling and failover
8. **Crosscutting**: Document patterns used consistently
9. **Decisions**: Use ADR format for traceability
10. **Quality**: Make requirements testable
11. **Risks**: Include mitigation strategies
12. **Glossary**: Define domain-specific terms
