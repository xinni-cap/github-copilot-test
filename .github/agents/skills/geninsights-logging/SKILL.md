**Action:** Starting code analysis
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress
**Skills Used:** discover-files, geninsights-logging

---
```

### 2. PROGRESS Entry

Log when completing significant milestones:

```markdown
## [TIMESTAMP] - [agent-name] - PROGRESS

**Milestone:** [Description of what was completed]
**Details:** [Specific findings or counts]
**Progress:** [X of Y items processed, or percentage]
**Skill Applied:** [If a skill was used for this step, mention it]

---
```

## Skill Usage Logging

**IMPORTANT:** Always log which skills you used during your work. This helps with:
- Traceability of how analysis was performed
- Understanding which skills are most valuable
- Debugging issues with specific skills

### When to Log Skill Usage

| Situation | Where to Log |
|-----------|--------------|
| Starting work with skills | In the STARTED entry under "Skills Used" |
| Using a skill for a specific step | In the PROGRESS entry under "Skill Applied" |
| Completing work | In the COMPLETED entry, list all skills used |

### Example Skill Usage in Log

```markdown

## When to Log PROGRESS

Log progress entries when:

| Agent | Log Progress When |
|-------|-------------------|
| documentor | Completing a major folder/package, every 10-20 files |

| code-assessment | Finding critical issues, completing review phases, every 10-15 files |
| uml | Completing each diagram type (class, sequence, use case) |
| bpmn | Completing each major workflow |
| architecture | Identifying architecture style, completing layer analysis, finding patterns |
| capability-mapping | Completing a business domain, every 10-15 files mapped |
| arc42 | Completing groups of sections (1-4, 5-7, 8-12) |

## Timestamp Format

Use ISO 8601 format or human-readable:
- `2026-02-05T10:15:32Z` (ISO)
- `2026-02-05 10:15:32` (readable)

## Log File Structure

The log file should have a header:

```markdown
# GenInsights Agent Work Log

---

[Log entries here, newest at bottom]
```

Copy and customize these templates:

**START:**
```markdown
## [TIMESTAMP] - [AGENT] - STARTED

**Action:** Starting [action]
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress

---
```

**PROGRESS:**
```markdown
